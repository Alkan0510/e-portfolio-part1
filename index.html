					<p>Hi, My name is Alger Kyan P. David, I am 14 years old at the time of encoding this mwahaha. My birthday is on May 10 (wow shocking, no one greets from the batch gc (please don't greet me))  <br><br> I like coding more than anything else in the world, though not on this side of developing, I despise front-end coding, I love back-end developing though. Currently I'm self-learning on Python for experience and AutoCad since it's needed for Technolympiads at the time of encoding this lol. I love Jazz, I love music that gives off a calm vibe, artists I can name is Wanuka (goated artist), Seycara (goated artist), Yellow Cherry Jam (goated lofi artist), some of Acousphere's guitar covers, Forrest Frank (goated artist) and much more! Just ask me face-to-face and I'll be willing to give you songs that fit this genre of mine!  </p>

				<p> Here's DaFam! This is my family, they're the ones who formed the guy I am today, they support me whenever they can and they love me just like how I love them! My family is generally caring to others and we are a God-fearing family! Our whole family is Christian. Every Sunday, me and my siblings and mother go to our local church, Berean Bible Baptist Church (both pics up there) while our father goes to CCF Southmall. We mostly stay at home unless invited to go somewhere by our friends or relatives. Every Saturaday, me and my brother go to church to go distribute gospel tracts in the morning, chorale practice and discipleship (Only me) in the afternoon, and listen to the Adult Choir practice at night, while our father goes to his band practice in CCF. Enough about me, Let's visit the other sections of this webpage! </p>

				<p> Hello, welcome to my AP Interactive Webpage, in this section of the whole interactive webpage is the table of contents for AP in order for you to ACTUALLY look at the lessons we had this quarter and the reflection, this was honestly a fun quarter since it tackled about some concepts I like in general and found the lessons very easy, to further expand each lesson, you may click the box with the lessons name inside it. <br><br> The info in each lesson is what I took during class and what I understood at the time to make it easier, so don't expect a lot.

			<h1> Reflection </h1>
			<p>The most important thing I learned from the event is that our language and traditions are living parts of our identities. I can apply what I learned by speaking Tagalog in daily conversations (like how I normally would in my house, I just speak English in class because most people use English as their language). I actively participated in this event by doing my best in the classroom-based declamation in front though we all know I suck at speaking in front. If i were to teach this subect to my classmate, I would use songs, poems, folk stories, or simple role-play activities. It is important to have an event per subject because themed activities focus attention, deepen our understanding towards that subject, and create emotional connections that help learning stick (in our head. Brain I suppose).</p>

			<h1> Reflection </h1>
			<p>The most important thing I learned here is to not sacrifice yourself for others because there's still a slight chance of them losing (right, ANDREI?!), and to practice the sport beforehand. I can apply what I learned by preparing everything before I do an action. I actively participated in this event by joining the Table Tennis (Ping-Pong) Set A and take the major shots so Andrei has a shot to win (he lost due to coaching system though). To teach this to a classmate, I would organize small friendly games and debrief (what's debrief anyways) afterward to highlight teamwork, strategy, sportsmanship, and picking the right set. (yeaaaaaa, Andrei's definitely part of this reflection now). Having an event per subject is important because it provides hands-on practice, builds soft skills, and moticates students through active participation.</p>

			<h1> Reflection </h1>
			<p>The most important thing I learned from this event is that you should know when to go solo, or go as a group in making a research., as ALL of us got cooked in the research defense I can apply what I learned by either choosing the <b>BEST</b> teammates for research, or just to go solo if you're well-versed over your study. I actively participated in this event by defending our research (even though we FAILED because of one word in the title). If i were to teach this subject to my classmate, I would use short, safe hands-on expermients and clear explanations to show a scientific method in action. It's important to have an event per subject because practical demonstartions make abstract ideas concrete and spark curiosity that textbook reading alone may not.</p>

			<h1> Reflection </h1>
			<p>The most important thing I learned from Teacher's Day is how much teachers invest on our learning and wellbeing, and how Ms. Gia, our adviser, is very loving and caring towards us. I can apply what I learned by showing appreciation, being respectful, and helping make the classroom a positive place for everyone (no one's gonna be left out, trust me). I actively participated by joining our class' intermission, but they didn't let me perform (what a sad day for Alger as this is his FIFTH time in a row signing up for an intermission but was never given a chance to, what a sad hobo). If I were to teach this event to my classmate, I would organize a short tribute activity and a discussion about the many roles teachers play in our lives (its a lot, you gotta appreciate them for it). Having an event per subject matters because it recognizes contibutions, strengthens school community, and reminds students why the event and its teachers matter.</p>

			<h1> Reflection </h1>
			<p>The most important thing I learned from this event is that you REALLY should listen to the seminars they give and review the content they give for Quiz Bee (i got cooked on both quiz bees, yes the seminar had a QUIZ). I can apply what I learned by reviewing before a quiz, though I might rarely do this ngl (I just memorize in class while the lesson is happening so my cognitive load is just split to me memorizing and hearing, wait i feel like this is a different topic on the reason why i don't write notes that much...)... I actively participated in this event by answering the classroom-based quiz bee for this even (Kiel and Yeuffa REPRESENTATIVES ggs). If I were to teach this subject to my classmate, I would use examples like buying, saving, and deamnd and supply activities to explain economic ideasd clearly. It is important to have an event per subject because it allows students to experience how classroom lessons connect to real-life situations and develop practical skills for the future.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="introduction">
			<p> Just like how the elements of human body were layered and placed on top of each other–bones, muscles, veins, etc., to become a whole, the web page, is also composed of layers to make it whole. <br><br> Each layer of the webpage has its specific use or function in the web page. Each plays an important role to be able to attain the goal or objective of a particular website. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
				<li><p>Define and layout the text, images, animation, sound, ideo and everything you want to put in a web page with the use of tags</p></li>
				<li><p>is the underlying HTML code of that page. Just as a house's frame creates a strong foundation upon which the rest of the house is built, a solid foundation of HTML creates a platform upon which a website can be created</p></li>
				<br><br>
				<p><b> Content Layer needs to have: </b></p>
				<li><p>Text that is easy to understand</p></li>
				<li><p>Text that makes sense without a visual representation</p></li>
				<li><p>Alternative Text for every image, sound piece, or video taht is content</p></li>
				<li><p>Text that is fit for the web (KISS: Keep It Short and simple, structured into headers, paragraphs and lists)</p></li>
				<li><p>Explanations of Acronyms and Abbreviations</p></li>
				<li><p>Content images need to be unambiguous for the colorblind and text in images needs to have a sufficient size and contrast</p></li>
				<li><p>Information to the users of changes necessary to her environment.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1">Presentation Layer</h1>
		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
				<p> The presentation layer is where you can define how people see your web page in a browser </p>
				<br><br>
				<p><b> Presentation Layer needs to: </b></p>
				<li><p>Ensures that text can be zoomed without making the site unusable</p></li>
				<li><p>Ensure that the interactive elements of the site are easy to find</p></li>
				<li><p>Ensure that images and foreground and background have enough contrast and are unambiguous to the colorblind</p></li>
				<li><p>Give the site a consistent navigation</p></li>

		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
				<p> The behavior layer is where you have a real-time user interaction with the web page. The interaction may be simple validation of input or filling out a form or even as big as web-based programs</p>
				<br><br>
				<p><b> Behaviour Layer needs to: </b></p>
				<li><p>Ensure that all the functionality is available to the user regardless of input device</p></li>

				<p>In comparison, HTML is used to create the actual content/foundation of the page and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, including thelayout, visual effects, and background color</p>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1">Benefits of using CSS</h1>
		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
			<p><b>CSS saves a lot of work</b></p>
			<p> You do not have to code the CSS repeatedly into an HTML file. You just need to write the CSS code once and then reuse the same stylesheet in multiple HTML pages. This saves coding time and space of your hard disk</p>
		
			<p><b>Easy Maintenance</b></p>
			<p>You can control the look and layout of several HTML pages at once. In other terms, one CSS file can control EVERY HTML file connected to the CSS file.</p>
		
			<p><b>Adding Style to webpage makes it more pleasing to the eye</b></p>
			<p>Improve the appearance of a website by allowing you to create a much more stylish website since CSS offers a wide array of expressive style capableness</p>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1">Capabilities of CSS</h1>
		<div class="introduction">
			<ol>
				<li><p>CSS makes your pages easily updateable. CSS makes it possible to update the layout of the entire page quickly. You can specify a style once and you can apply it as many times in your document.</p></li>
				<li><p>Position objects on the page. CSS gives you control when placing objects on the page exactly where you want them</p></li>
				<li><p>Layer objects on the page. CSS allows you to position objects in three dimensions.</p></li>
				<li><p>Create custom tags. CSS allows you to create custom tags to achieve specialized objectives.</p></li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<h1 class="h1">Advantages of using CSS</h1>
		<div class="introduction">
			<ol>
				<li><p>Save typing and development time because you have to enter CSS code only once and it can be applied to many HTML scripts.</p></li>
				<li><p>Download faster because your browser will download only one file once.</p></li>
				<li><p>Faster page loading.</p></li>
				<li><p>You can also have multiple link tags in one document.</p></li>
				<li><p>Better design flexibility.</p></li>
				<li><p>Easier to maintain and update.</p></li>
				<li><p>Separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS).</p></li>

			<p><b> Selector </b></p>
			<p> The HTML element you want to style; is a pattern used to "find" or "select" the HTML elements on a webpage to which a set of CSS rules will be applied. for e.g, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc.. </p>
			<p><b>Property</b></p>
			<p>The style attribute you want to modify; is a named characteristic or attribute that defines a specific aspect of how an HTML element should be displayed or rendered by the browser. Properties are used within CSS declarations to apply styles to selected elements.</p>
			<p><b>Value</b></p>
			<p>The weight of the attribute you want to apply to the element property; is the specific setting or configuration assigned to a CSS property. A property and its value form a CSS declaration, which dictates how an element should be styled</p>
			<p><b>Declaration</b></p>
			<p>Is a single instruction that defines a specific style for an element.</p>
			<p><b>Declaration Block</b></p>
			<p>Fundamental part of a CSS rule. It is a blcok of code that contains one or more CSS declarations, which define the styling rules for the selected HTML element(s)</p>

		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
				<li><p> A set of instructions to a web browser on how to display various elements on a web page is known as style sheet</p></li>
				<li><p> Every CSS (whether it is contained in a .css file, or embedded in the head element of an HTML document) is a series of instructions called statements</p></li>
				<ul>
					<p><b>The statement does two things</b></p>
					<li><p>It identifies the elements in an HTML document that it affects.</p></li>
					<li><p>It tells the browser how to draw these elements.</p</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Elements are considered to be paragraphs, links, list items, and so on. In technical terms, HTML terms, an element is anything marked up inside html tags.</p>

		<h1 class="h1"> How do style sheets work </h1>
		<div class="whole-section1">
		<div class="introduction">
			<ul>
				<p> Style sheets are just text files, or text embedded in the head of an HTML document, that help separate content from appearance. The content of the page goes into an HTML file. And the appearance goes into a style sheet. But how does all this end up as a web page in the reader's browser?</p>
				<p><b>A style sheet suggests the browser to display a page in a particular way, how the pages should be displayed in the browser </b></p>
				<ol>
					<p><b> There are two things that you should remember when using the CSS code: </b></p>
					<li><p> The type attribute should always be &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;.</p></li>
					<li><p>CSS Code should be enclosed in HTML comments &lt;!...--&gt; so that in a web browser that does not understand CSS, the browser will not see the CSS code. But today, however, all current browsers support CSS.</p></li>

						<li><p>Classes are defined by dots (.)</p></li>
						<li><p>There are two methods of writing a class.</p>
						<ol>
							<li><p>Indicating the HTML element followed by a dot then followed by the class name (any name you want for it).<br><br>Example:<b> p.golden&lbrace;color: blue;&gt;</b></p></li>
							<li><p>Writing the class name preceded by a dot (.)<br><br>Example:<b> .sodapop&lbrace;color: red;&rbrace;</b></p></li>

						</li>
						<li><p>In HTML, you can apply it using the <b>class="classname"</b> attribute</p></li>
						<li><p>The example <b> p.golden&lbrace;color: blue;&rbrace; </b> is a style that can be used on paragraphs.</p></li>
						<li><p>The example <b> .sodapop&lbrace;color: red;&rbrace; </b> can be used on any HTML element.</p></li>
						<li><p>A class must be called on the HTML file for it to be used. <br> How is this done? <br><br> Calling classes are done by putting the <b> class </b> attribute in the tag you want to style and the <b> class name </b> as its value</p></li>

					<ul>
						<li><p>Selects HTML elements (p, div, h1, etc.) and applies CSS to them.</p></li>
						<p> Example CSS Code: <br> p &lbrace;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;&rbrace;</p>

				<h1 class="h1">ID Selector</h1>
				<div class="introduction2">
					<ul>
						<li><p>Is a style applied to one element in a page.</p></li>
						<li><p>Normally used once, usually in a page title or the navigation part of the page.</p></li>
						<li><p>Defined by '#' and uses id attribute of the HTML element.</p></li>
						<li><p>ID selectors selects the HTML element with a unique identifier (id) and adds CSS to it.</p></li>
						<li><p>It is not advisable to start an id selector with a number because some browsers o not support it.</p></li>
						<li><p>The ID selector is unique and selects one unique element.</p></li>
						<p> Example HTML code: <br>&lt;div id="header"&gt;Welcome to my website&lt;/div&gt;</p>

				<div class="introduction2">
					<ul>
						<p><b>Class Selector:</b></p>
						<li><p>Use a class selector when you want to apply the same style to multiple elements or when elements share a common category or purpose. Use class when styling many elements that share the same style, even if they have different tags.</p></li>
						<p><b>ID Selector:</b></p>
						<li><p>Use an ID selector when styling a unique element that appears only once on a page.</p></li>
						<p><b>Element/Tag Selector:</b></p>
						<li><p>Use an element selector to style all occurences of a specific HTML tag.</p></li>
						<p><b>Universal Selector:</b></p>
						<li><p>Use the universal selector when you want to style all elements on the page. For example, to reset margins, padding, or box-sizing.</p></li>
